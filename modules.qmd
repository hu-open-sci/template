## Overview

This page outlines the four main **modules** of the course and their associated weeks, topics, and key activities. Use this as a roadmap for the semester and a guide to the detailed readings and assignments posted on the course site.

## Module 1: Foundations of Open Science

**Weeks:** 1–4  
**Guiding questions:** What is open science, why has it emerged, and how does it relate to reproducibility?

### Weekly Breakdown

**Week 1 – What is Open Science?**  
- Topics: History and motivations, open vs. closed research, myths about openness.  
- Activities: Discussion of exemplar open projects, short diagnostic survey on prior experience.  
- Suggested Deliverable: Reflection on your current research workflow.

**Week 2 – The Reproducibility Crisis**  
- Topics: Replication failures, methodological reforms, preregistration and registered reports.  
- Activities: Reading discussion on replication case studies, in-class critique of a methods section.  
- Suggested Deliverable: Reflection 1 (reproducibility in your field).

**Week 3 – Frameworks and Standards**  
- Topics: FAIR principles, TOP guidelines, data and code availability statements.  
- Activities: Group mapping of a research project to FAIR and TOP, discussion of journal policies.  
- Suggested Deliverable: Short memo identifying a target journal’s openness policies.

**Week 4 – Research Workflows and Project Structure**  
- Topics: Folder organization, naming conventions, documentation as part of the workflow.  
- Activities: Walkthrough of a well-organized open project repository.  
- Graded Deliverable: Lab 1 – Project skeleton (directories, README, basic documentation).

**Week 6 – GitHub for Collaboration**  
- Topics: Remote repositories, pull requests, issues, project boards.  
- Activities: Pair activity using pull requests and code review; setting up a course organization or team.  
- Suggested Deliverable: Reflection 2 (collaboration norms and practices).

**Week 7 – Literate Programming with Quarto**  
- Topics: Quarto documents, parameters, rendering to HTML/PDF, reproducible reports.

## Module 3: Sharing, Collaboration, and Openness

**Weeks:** 9–11  
**Guiding questions:** How do we share our work responsibly and effectively so that others can reuse and build on it?

### Weekly Breakdown

**Week 9 – Sharing Data and Code**  
- Topics: Repositories (GitHub, OSF, Zenodo), DOIs, versioned releases.

## Module 4: Applications, Ethics, and Project Synthesis

**Weeks:** 12–14
