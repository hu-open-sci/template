## Final Open Project Assignment

The final project is a small, self-contained research or demonstration project that applies the full open science workflow you've learned throughout the course. Working individually or in pairs (with instructor approval), you'll create a public GitHub repository containing data (or simulated/open data), analysis code, a fully reproducible Quarto report or site, and comprehensive documentation. The project culminates in a 5–10 minute in-class presentation during Week 14. Key milestones include a proposal (Week 6), peer-reviewed draft (Week 11), and final submission (Week 14) worth 40% of your grade.

## Final Open Project Rubric

The final open project is evaluated using the rubric below. Each criterion is scored on a 4–point scale:

- 4 = Exemplary
- 3 = Proficient
- 2 = Developing
- 1 = Beginning

### Summary Table

| Criterion                       | Weight | 4 – Exemplary                                      | 3 – Proficient                                   | 2 – Developing                                   | 1 – Beginning                                      |
|---------------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Reproducibility of Workflow     | 25%    | Fully reproducible from clean clone with clear, automated steps | Mostly reproducible; minor manual steps or ambiguities | Partially reproducible; key steps undocumented   | Not reproducible; major steps missing or unclear   |
| Openness & Licensing            | 20%    | Appropriate licenses for code & content; clearly documented | Appropriate licenses with minor gaps in documentation | Licenses present but unclear or incomplete       | No clear licensing; reuse terms ambiguous          |
| Documentation & Organization    | 20%    | Repository is logically structured; README and docs are thorough and easy to follow | Structure is mostly clear; documentation covers main elements | Structure somewhat confusing; limited documentation | Disorganized repository; minimal or no documentation |
| Technical Quality & Rigor       | 20%    | Methods appropriate and clearly implemented; code and results are accurate and well explained | Methods generally appropriate; minor issues in code or explanation | Methods partially appropriate; noticeable errors or unclear reasoning | Methods inappropriate or unclear; serious errors    |
| Communication & Presentation    | 15%    | Report/site and presentation are clear, coherent, and engaging; story of the project is easy to follow | Communication is clear overall; some minor issues with flow or emphasis | Main ideas present but organization or clarity uneven | Difficult to follow; key ideas not clearly communicated |

## Criterion Details

### Reproducibility of Workflow (25%)

- Clear instructions in the `README` (or dedicated section) for how to set up and run the project.
- All necessary files (data, code, configuration) are present or clearly sourced.
- Use of scripted or automated steps (e.g., Quarto render, Makefile, or equivalent) where appropriate.

### Openness and Licensing (20%)

- Explicit licenses for:
  - Code (e.g., MIT, GPL, Apache).
  - Text, figures, and teaching materials (e.g., Creative Commons).
- Licensing information is easy to find and understand.
- Citations and attributions are used where materials from others are included.

### Documentation and Organization (20%)

- Logical folder structure (e.g., `data/`, `code/`, `docs/`, `outputs/`).
- `README` clearly explains project purpose, data sources, main files, and how to reproduce results.
- Additional documentation (e.g., data dictionary, comments in code) supports reuse.

### Technical Quality and Rigor (20%)

- Methods are appropriate for the research question or demonstration goal.
- Code runs without errors under reasonable conditions.
- Results are interpreted correctly and limitations are acknowledged.

### Communication and Presentation (15%)

- Written report or site is clearly structured (introduction, methods, results, discussion).
- Visuals (tables, figures) are readable, labeled, and integrated into the narrative.
- In-class presentation effectively summarizes the project and highlights open/reproducible practices.

## Scoring and Feedback

- Final score is computed by applying the weights above to each criterion score.
- Written feedback will highlight:
  - Strengths to carry forward into future work.
  - 1–3 specific areas for improvement in openness, reproducibility, or communication.
