When reusing or adapting open materials, you must provide proper attribution and follow the terms of the original licenses.\n\n\nAccessibility and Accommodations\nStudents requiring accommodations are encouraged to contact the instructor and the campus accessibility office as early as possible to ensure appropriate arrangements.\n\n\nTechnology and Data Ethics\nStudents are expected to follow ethical and legal guidelines in handling data. When using real-world datasets, ensure that data use complies with privacy and institutional or IRB policies where applicable."
