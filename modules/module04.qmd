## Overview

Module 4 synthesizes the course by applying open science practices across **disciplines**, addressing **ethical considerations**, and completing your open project for public sharing. Over three weeks, you will refine your work, present it to peers, and reflect on how to sustain these practices long-term.

- **Weeks:** 12–14  
- **Guiding questions:**  
  - What are the ethical, equity, and inclusion challenges of open science?  
  - How is open science practiced across different fields and contexts?  
  - How will you carry open practices forward in your own work?

## Week 12 – Ethics, Equity, and Inclusion in Open Science

**Focus:** Responsible and inclusive practices beyond technical implementation.

- Topics:
  - Data justice, privacy, and harms of over-sharing sensitive information.
  - Power dynamics, access barriers, and the digital divide in open scholarship.
  - Community-engaged research, citizen science, and participatory openness.

- In-class activities:
  - Case study discussions of ethical dilemmas in data/code sharing.
  - Group brainstorming of inclusive practices for documentation and collaboration.

- Suggested deliverable:
  - **Reflection 4 – Ethics and Equity**  
    Consider ethical and equity implications of openness for the communities, data, or contexts in your project.

- Suggested preparation:
  - Review your project through an ethics lens: what data are you sharing, with whom, and under what terms?

## Week 13 – Open Science in Practice

**Focus:** Real-world applications and sustainability.

- Topics:
  - Disciplinary case studies and open science success stories.
  - Institutional policies, funder mandates, and career implications.
  - Long-term sustainability: archiving, maintenance, and community contributions.

- In-class activities:
  - Guest speaker(s) or panel on open science in practice.
  - Project troubleshooting clinic and final polish workshop.
  - Discussion of next steps for students' projects post-course.

- Graded deliverable:
  - **Lab 5 – Project Refinement**  
    Complete a self-audit checklist and implement improvements for organization, documentation, reproducibility, and presentation readiness.

- Suggested preparation:
  - Run a "stranger test": can someone unfamiliar with your project reproduce key results?

## Week 14 – Project Presentations and Course Reflection

**Focus:** Sharing your work and synthesizing course learning.

- Topics:
  - Effective communication of open projects (READMEs, talks, write-ups).
  - Lessons learned and future directions for open science practice.
  - Course retrospective and peer feedback on final projects.

- In-class activities:
  - Student presentations (5–10 minutes each): project overview, workflow, key findings, openness features.
  - Group discussion: what surprised you, what will you change, what needs more work?

- Graded deliverable:
  - **Final Open Project** (repository + presentation)  
    Public GitHub repository with complete documentation, reproducible analysis/report/site, appropriate licensing, and evidence of peer review integration.

## Course Synthesis

Module 4 completes the progression from **concepts** → **tools** → **sharing** → **responsible practice**:

By now, you should have:
- A public, documented, reproducible project that demonstrates open science principles.
- Experience with the full workflow: planning, coding, collaborating, reviewing, sharing, and reflecting.
- A personal framework for evaluating and improving openness in future work.

## Next Steps Beyond the Course

- **Maintain your project repository** as a portfolio piece or living analysis.
- **Apply these practices** to your thesis, publications, or collaborations.
- **Contribute to open science** communities through code, feedback, or teaching others.
- **Stay connected** via course GitHub organization or open science networks in your field.
