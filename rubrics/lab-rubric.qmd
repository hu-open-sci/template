## Labs Assignment Overview

The five labs (6% each, 30% total) are structured, hands-on exercises that progressively build skills in project organization, version control, reproducible reporting, licensing, and refinement. Each lab builds directly on the previous one, culminating in a polished open project repository ready for public sharing.

## Labs Rubric (Each Lab - 6 points)

Each lab is scored on a 4-point scale across four equally weighted criteria (25% each):

| Criterion              | 4 – Exemplary (100%)                          | 3 – Proficient (85%)                       | 2 – Developing (70%)                       | 1 – Beginning (50%)                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Task Completion**    | All required elements complete and correct    | Most elements complete; minor issues       | Partial completion; key elements missing   | Minimal completion or incorrect           |
| **Technical Execution**| Works perfectly; clean, efficient implementation | Works with minor issues; functional       | Works with significant issues              | Doesn't work or fundamentally broken      |
| **Documentation**      | Clear commit messages, README updates, code comments | Adequate documentation; some gaps        | Limited or unclear documentation           | No documentation or misleading            |
| **Open Practices**     | Excellent Git use; meaningful version history and structure | Basic Git use; reasonable history        | Minimal Git use or poor history            | No version control or disorganized        |

## Criterion Details

### Task Completion (25%)
Did you complete all specific deliverables for that lab?
- Lab 1: Complete project folder structure with directories and initial README
- Lab 2: Git repository with multiple meaningful commits and branch/merge demo
- Lab 3: Working Quarto document that renders from raw data to final output
- Lab 4: Appropriate licenses added with clear documentation/rationale
- Lab 5: Completed checklist with documented improvements implemented

### Technical Execution (25%)
Does the work function as expected and demonstrate the target skill?
- Code runs without errors
- Outputs match expectations
- Implements the specific technical skill being taught

### Documentation (25%)
Are changes tracked and explained clearly?
- Meaningful Git commit messages that describe what changed and why
- Updated README with clear reproduction instructions
- Inline code comments where complexity warrants explanation

### Open Practices (25%)
Does the work demonstrate emerging habits of open, reproducible science?
- Logical repository organization
- Version control used throughout the process
- Evidence of iterative development through commit history
- Structure supports future collaboration or reuse

## Grading Process

- **Completion focus**: Labs emphasize skill acquisition over perfection
- **Holistic scoring**: Each criterion scored independently, then averaged
- **Feedback**: Brief comments via GitHub issues highlighting strengths and 1-2 areas for improvement
- **Late policy**: 10% per day penalty (up to 50% maximum deduction)

## Submission Expectations

Submit all labs to Canvas (in .html) and by pushing your work to your designated course GitHub repository. Name files clearly (e.g., `lab1-project-skeleton/`, `lab3-repro-report.qmd`) and tag each lab completion with a release or clear commit message.
