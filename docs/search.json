Clarify how this applies to labs, reflections, and the final project.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nAll work must comply with institutional policies on academic integrity. When reusing or adapting open materials, you must provide proper attribution and follow the terms of the original licenses.\n\n\nAccessibility and Accommodations\nStudents requiring accommodations are encouraged to contact the instructor and the campus accessibility office as early as possible to ensure appropriate arrangements.\n\n\nTechnology and Data Ethics\nStudents are expected to follow ethical and legal guidelines in handling data.
